# pypliers
## Overview

An arsenal of utilities to handle, reshape and morph Python data-structures

> `pypliers` is designated to be complementary to `pytoolz`, rather than providing a full-fledged solution on its own. It is built to be functional and as such it pairs very well with `whatever`, `operator` and a nice glass of Bordeaux.
